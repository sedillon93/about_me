      <!-- <p class="intro">It's great that you stopped by to learn some more about me today. Here's a little information about me to start getting acquainted. I'm sure we'll get to know each other better over the next few weeks!</p>
      <p class="question">Question 1: I was born in Washington state.</p>
      <p class="answer">Answer: Nope! Originally I am from a suburb outside of Philadelphia. I spent my first 18 years in the same town.</p>
      <p class="question">Question 2: In college I majored in chemistry</p>
      <p class="answer">Answer: Not quite...I started out as a chemistry major but found that I loved geology more during my sophomore year and switched majors.</p>
      <p class="question">Question 3: I spent five years studying German in school.</p>
      <p class="answer">Answer: Yep! My grandmother grew up in Germany and I started learning the language in middle school to connect more with her.</p>
      <p class="question">Question 4: I went to Colgate University in central New York.</p>
      <p class="answer">Answer: Yep! I spent four years in beautiful rural New York. First time I experienced windchills down to -20s and snow piled thigh high through April.<img src = "http://aminoapps.com/static/bower/emojify.js/images/emoji/snowflake.png" class = "snowflake"/></p>
      <p class="question">Question 5: Scuba diving is one of my favorite activities.</p>
      <p class="answer">Answer: Yep! I got scuba certified for my senior thesis project researching coral reefs and loved it. If I could I would live in the reefs.</p>
      <p class="question">Question 6: How many years did I work in elementary schools?<p>
      <p class="answer">Answer: 2 years. I worked as a TA in two different independent schools in Washington state, primarily teaching elementary aged students. It was a lot of fun and had a large impact on the way I communicate with others and approach learning something new myself.</p>
      <p class="question">Question 7: What is one of my favorite activities?</p>
      <p class="answer">Answer: There are a lot of different things I enjoy doing, but most of them involve being outside, food, or creating something. A few of my favorites are coding, baking, biking, reading, swimming, and hiking (and of course scuba diving!).</p> -->
